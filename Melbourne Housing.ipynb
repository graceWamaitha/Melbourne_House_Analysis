    "## Introduction\n",
    "The Melbourne Housing Company (MHC) is a real estate agency specializing in the sale of residential properties across Melbourne and its surrounding regions. The company works closely with homeowners, property developers, and prospective buyers to facilitate smooth and transparent property transactions. As part of its operations, MHC collects detailed information on each property it manages-from physical attributes such as the number of rooms, bedrooms, bathrooms, car spaces, land size and building area as well as contextual factors including surburb, region, postcode and distance from key locations(CBD-Central Business District) and temporal information such as sale date along with metadata such as the type of house and the sales person involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Dictionary\n",
    "* Suburb -suburb in which the property is located\n",
    "* Rooms - Number of rooms in the property\n",
    "* Type - Type of the property like\n",
    "    * h - house, cottage,villa,semi,terrace\n",
    "    * t - townhouse\n",
    "    * u - unit,duplex\n",
    "* SellerG - Name of the real estate agent who sold the property\n",
    "* Date - Date on which the property was sold\n",
    "* Distance - Distance of the property from CBD in kilometres.\n",
    "* Postcode - postcode of the area\n",
    "* Bedroom - number of bedrooms in the property\n",
    "* Bathroom - number of bathrooms in the property\n",
    "* Car - Number of car parking space in the property\n",
    "* Landsize - Size of the land in square metres\n",
    "* Building Area - size of the building in square metres\n",
    "* Yearbuilt - Year in which the building was built\n",
    "* Regionname - Name of the region in which the property is located\n",
    "* Propertycount - Number of properties that are present in the suburb\n",
    "* Price - price in AUD at which the property was sold\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem statement\n",
    "The Melbourne Housing Company seeks to **improve the accuracy and consistency of its property valuation process**. Currently, it lacks a reliable analytical framework to translate property attributes into precise price estimates. This limitation affects the agency's ability to guide clients confidently, set competitive listing prices, and **anticipate market behaviour**. To address this challenge, the company aims to leverage its historical sales data to uncover the key *factors that influence housing prices* and develop a **predictive** model capable of approximating the expected selling price of a property based on its physical and contextual characteristics; this will subsequently strenghten decision-making, support its sales team with data-driven insights, enhance customer trust, and maintain competitivenss in Melbourne dynamic housing market.\n"

    "## Analysis approach\n",
    "* **Pricing and Valuation**\n",
    "    1. Which physical features (rooms, bedrooms, bathrooms, car spaces, land size, building area) have the strongest influence on house prices?\n",
    "    2. How does distance from the CBD affect price?\n",
    "    3. Can we predict the price of a property accurately using the available features?\n",
    "    4. How much more (or less) do properties in certain suburbs or regions sell for compared to others?\n",
    "    5. How does the year a house was built influence its selling price?\n",
    "* **Market Trends and Demand**\n",
    "    1. What are the seasonal patterns in property sales?(Do prices rise in certain months?)\n",
    "    2. Are certain suburbs experiencing increasing or decreasing prices over time?\n",
    "    3. Which property types(house, unit, townhouse) are performing best in the current market?\n",
    "    4. How does property count in a suburb relate to the average price?\n",
    "* **Agent and Operational Performance**\n",
    "    1. Whhich salespersons consistently achieve higher sales prices or faster sales?\n",
    "    2. Is there a difference in property price performance between different sales agents?\n",
    "    3. Does property type or location influence which salesperson should be assigned to a listing?\n",
    "* **Customer and Location insights**\n",
    "    1. What characteristics describe the most expensive vs most affordable suburbs?\n",
    "    2. How do surburbs differ in terms of average land size, building area, or number of rooms?\n",
    "    3. Which regions show the fastest market growth or highest demand?\n",
    "* **Property Characteristic and Optimization**\n",
    "    1. What combination of features yeilds the best return on investment for sellers?\n",
    "    2. Is adding an extra bedroom, bathroom, or parking space associated with a sustantial Increase in price?\n",
    "    3. How do older houses compare to newer ones in terms of price per square meter?\n",
    "* **Data Quality and Strategic Insights**\n",
    "    1. Are there inconsistencies in the collected data that may hinder pricing accuracy?\n",
    "    2. Which features should be prioritized when collecting new data to improve future predictions?"
