# Melbourne Housing Data Analysis
## Description
In this project, I focus on performing a comprehensive analysis on Melbourne Housing dataset.The goal is to explore the data in depth, understand its structure, uncover meaningful patterns and prepare it for accurate modeling. This analysis includes the following aspects:
  * Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA): Examining distributions, relationships and trends within the dataset.
  * Data Cleaning: Identifying and handling inconsistencies, duplicates and noise.
  * Missing Value Treatment: Assessing the extent of missing data and applying appropriate strategies to address them.
Overall, I aim to produce a clean and well understood dataset that can support modeling for housing prices.
## Resources Used
* Data
  * Melbourne Housing Dataset(in csv)
* Tools
  * Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) - For data cleaning, EDA and analysis scripts.
  * Jupyter Notebook - Main workspace for step-by-step exploration.
  * Tableau - for interactive visualizations and dashboards.
* Platform
  * GitHub - for hosting and documentation
